# LiveLearnDo — Coming Soon

This is a lightweight, single-file landing page you can deploy anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, shared hosting).

## Quick start
1. Edit `index.html`:
   - Update the description text to match your message.
   - Replace the Formspree `action` with your endpoint (or remove the form).
   - Change contact email if needed.
2. Deploy:
   - **GitHub Pages**: push to a repo, enable Pages (branch: `main`, folder: `/root`). 
   - **Netlify/Vercel**: drag-and-drop or connect your repo.
   - **Shared hosting**: upload `index.html` to your web root (often `public_html`).
3. Point your domain:
   - Set DNS `A`/`CNAME` records per your hosting provider’s docs.
4. (Optional) Add analytics (e.g., Plausible, Google Analytics).

## Notes
- No external dependencies. CSS is embedded for simplicity.
- Accessible and responsive by default.
